# Understanding — and working within — the existing culture of the community

## Every accelerator needs a community. Every community does not need an accelerator. 

Communities exist on a spectrum. Some communities don't even realize that they're communities. Others are a loosely assembled  group of individuals who identify with peers and members of their community through a feeling of commonality and affinity, even though they lack definition, infrastructure, and process for formalizing that community. Still other communities are well defined, organized, and managed as communities. 

[*PLACEHOLDER] Provide analogies/examples of each of the communities above*.

When it comes to accelerators, no one type of community has a particular advantage over any other. They all have their respective pros and cons. 

Amorphous and nebulous communities, for example, have the benefit of needing the structure accelerators bring to a community. That's an upside. No pre-existing conditions or competition or toes on which to step. That's awesome. On the downside, these ill defined communities are — well — ill defined. As such, they don't have easily accessible resources into which an accelerator can immediately tap. The onus, therefore, is on the accelerator to create these assets and resources from scratch. 

Conversely, a well established community — on the upside — could have a wealth of infrastructure and programmatic elements which can be leveraged by an accelerator. While on the downside, it may have pre-existing and well established players, organizations, and cultural mores that prevent an accelerator from being as effective as it can be — without spending significant political capital to navigate the existing infrastructure. 

See? Pros and cons. No community is perfect.

What we're saying is that the community doesn't have to be a certain kind of community to support the concept of an accelerator. It simply has to exist. As a community. Even if the members of said community are still not fully cognizant of the community's existence or their inclusion therein. 

If you, as the accelerator perceive something that behaves like community — no matter how ill defined — then there's enough there to begin.  

## Accelerators function within communities 

Accelerators can be a means of bringing an existing — but nebulous and ill defined — community together. Or accelerating the momentum of an organized community. 

But make no mistakes. Accelerators are not a means of creating a community from scratch. And this is an assumption that most people make. Many potential accelerator founders are enamored of the concept of creating an accelerator that will somehow result in the creation of an amazing and vibrant community. It's actually the converse that is true.

Community first. Accelerator second. 

To be successful, you must work *within* the context and culture of your existing community. You're not going to be successful trying to build something that flies in the face of the community in which you're trying to build it.

Let's see if we can provide an example from the world of tech startups. 

## The next Silicon Valley.

C'mon. We've all said it. It's kind of a right of passage for any tech startup community. We're building the "next Silicon Valley." 

No you're not.

No one is building the next Silicon Valley. Nor should they. They should be building the next version of Portland or Stuttgart or Jakarta. Not the next Silicon Valley. Because that's a completely unattainable archetype that flies in the face of most communities existing culture. And none of us is going to live long enough, work hard enough, or invest enough capital to see this goal through. Even if it were possible. Which it's not. 

Anymore than somewhere is going to become the next Hollywood. 

Look. It's not that we don't believe in you or your passion or your abilities. It's not that we don't recognize the potential upside of having a mini Silicon Valley in your backyard. Or the potential positive economic impact for your community. 

I get it. It's the penultimate startup utopia. (It's not.)

We all have role models or things to which we aspire. I get it. Often, when we start new projects or set goals, we look first to the epitome of success for guidance. For something to emulate. For something to which we can aspire. And I doubt it will come as a shock to you that, for many startup communities, folks quickly gravitate toward the Bay Area as that role model. 

I know. Shocking.

It becomes the goal for what others want to be. As it appears to be. Now. Currently. And as those new people consider replicating that success, they are often wont to start where it is today. Jumping to the end result of the successful model. Rather than taking a step back to asses how that role model community actually achieved their current status. Rather than figuring out where they started. Or what elements were in place that enabled them to become what they are today.

It’s only natural. Those trailblazers make it look so easy. We never see all of the messiness. And the effort. And fuckups. We just see what it is today. With all of its media attention. And its bright and shiny benefits.

And we want that. The finished product. Without all of that ramping up and whatnot. That ramping up stuff is hard. Let’s just skip that and just make our startup scene “the next Bay Area.” Easy peasy.

But as we all know, that’s never going to happen. With a very few and extremely rare notable exceptions, there are no shortcuts to creating something lasting and sustainable. There is no diving into the deep end of the pool and learning how to swim immediately.

But there is a way to do it. And I believe it may lay in spending some time considering the underpinnings of the community itself. How it formed. Why it formed. And what trends or themes seem to replicate, time and time again, within the community. Because I think quiet undercurrent may have more influence on business success that any of us is willing to admit.

I am putting forth the hypothesis that the likelihood of building a sustainable startup community — complete with accelerators and startups and funding — has a far greater likelihood of success if, and only if, you carefully consider the history of successful businesses in your community.

What do I mean by that? Well, let’s take a look.

## A culture of wealth creation

Since it's founding, the Bay Area has been driven by a particular culture: the culture wealth creation. Generation after generation.

Sure. They solve some really interesting problems along the way. But those solutions aren't the motivation. Creating wealth is. 

San Francisco and the areas that surround it have always been driven by the pursuit of rapid financial gain Admittedly, I’m no San Francisco scholar. But even a rudimentary knowledge of the region reveals that the vast majority of success stories in the area are driven by the prospect (pun intended) of getting rich quick.

The gold rush. Military contracts. Semiconductors. Enterprise hardware. Internet connectivity. Personal computing. The dotcom days. SaaS. Unicorns. Decacorns. 

I’m sure I’m missing a bunch of stuff there. But you get the point. If there's a means of working extremely hard to create an extreme amount of wealth, it's highly likely to be attractive to that kind of culture.

Maybe your community has a similar kind of history and ethos. If so, you should embrace that and figure out how to make an accelerator work within that culture. But if not, don't try to create that culture.

Again, let's move beyond our adolescent dreams of emulating the Bay Area and focus, instead, on what your community does well, how the culture drives industry in your region, and how an accelerator can amplify that activity for the good of startups, investors, and the economy as a whole.

Because much like an accelerator must come to being within an existing community, a community will be far more successful following the pervading culture of a town, city, or region.
