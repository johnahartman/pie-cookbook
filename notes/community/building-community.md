The most challenging part of building community is resisting the urge to bring the community to you. You don't get to bring the community to you until you've gone to them.

It seems counterintuitive. That when you want to be a gracious host or curator that you should first have to rely on the hospitality of others. But it's how it works. 

Visit first. Participate elsewhere. Long before you create a space of your own. Because that's where the community lives. Out there. And asking them to come to you is presumptive. You need to be part of the community first.

There is a time and place for hosting. But it's not at the beginning. At the beginning you have to go where the community is.

But where do you go? Well, if you've done an effective job of assessing your community, the nodes and inflection points should be apparent. Not obvious, but apparent. Conversely, if you find yourself asking "Where is our community?" then you have more assessment work to do. 

What types of events should you attend? That's easy. All of them. Attend all the things.

This phase is a continuation of the assessment phase. It will serve as a guide for the future events that you will first host. And then create. To fill in the gaps. 

This can seem a bit daunting. But it's necessary. 

If you're already a participant in the community, it's easier. But it's still a change in your role in the community. Moving from participant to developer or manager. 

If you've recognized a leader — think [Brad Feld](http://www.feld.com/ "Brad Feld") in Boulder, [Mark Suster](https://bothsidesofthetable.com/ "Both Sides of the Table by Mark Suster") in LA, [Chris DeVore](https://twitter.com/crashdev "Chris DeVore on Twitter") in Seattle, [Jeff Slobotski](https://twitter.com/slobotski "Jeff Slobotski on Twitter") in Omaha — then your engagement becomes easier still. But let's be honest. Most of us do not have these kinds of roles in our respective communities. So we have to start with more of a grassroots movement. Of participating. Like those folks above did. Before their communities — or you — knew who they were. 

If you have these kinds of amazing connectors as part of your community, you're in luck. Because these folks will serve as an effective barometer to help you determine where to be. Either as a positive motivator ("They're going. I should go.") or negative motivator ("They're not going. I should go.").

If you don't have already established leaders in the community, then your job will be more difficult. And you may want to prepare yourself to become that community leader. 

## Work with what you have

What if the community you discover and into which you pour energy turns out to be the wrong community? Or what if the community you have is not the community you want?

Start with what you have. And work towards what you want.

## Always remember that communities change. Constantly.

Don't get too smug once you've identified a community. Or become a participant. Or become a leader. Communities change. Constantly. Or it may be the wrong community. Or you may be the wrong person for that community. Or the community you need may be a subset of a larger community you're exploring.

Sometimes, community dynamics change. And new gaps arise. Or new challenges. Sometimes the problems you solve reveal other problems. Or opportunities.

Community development is never complete. And it is never repeatable. It's different each and every time. Worst of all, your community dynamics will continue to change even under the most effective management. It's just how communities work. 

And often, that's completely okay. Because change is good for the community. Hard. But good.

Therefore, you should be constantly judging and reassessing your community to ensure it is meeting the current needs of the community. 

Like any startup, communities must constantly change to meet the needs of their constituencies. Sometimes, this may result in changes that result in long time community members finding that the new version of the community no longer meets the needs that made it attractive in the first place. This is a constant challenge. 

## Beware of your "community" becoming a "scene"

Community is engaged, changing, and collaborative. A scene is noisy and non participative. There are often more people attracted to a scene, but it is not nearly as productive as a community. More people doesn't mean more effective. In many cases, the opposite is true. A small community trumps a big scene any day of the week.

Scenes benefit the individual. Communities benefit the whole. 

Community is hard. But it is the most critical ingredient in the accelerator recipe. Even if what it tells you is not to build an accelerator. Perhaps especially if that's the case.

Without community, you have nothing.

## Manage lightly and humbly

Be cautious of over managing and over programming your community.  Communities need time to rest and breathe. 

And they exist with their own momentum. While that momentum can be influenced, it cannot often be changed. You have to go with the community flow. Even if it's frustrating. 

Different voices will rise and fall. Different leadership will rise and fall. You don't always have to lead. You don't always have to follow.

It is not your job to rule or manage. It is your job to develop and support.

You are simply a steward.

## Community is a product

And like any product, you must take risks, make changes, fail, stumble into unintended success, a listen to each member of the community for clues on what to do next. Always listen.

If community is a product, then community management is product management.
