If you haven't read Startup Communities by Brad Feld, please take the time to do so. Many of the things we did accidentally in Portland — or things which happened by luck — are clearly articulated in the book. If you're working to develop and support a nascent community, Feld's book provides a critical roadmap for that development — as well as delineating a timeline for how long you should expect that development to take.
