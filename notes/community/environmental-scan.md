# Taking an environmental scan

So we keep hammering on this "you have to build an accelerator *within* an existing community" point. Because we think it's important. But once you've identified the community that is to be the protective ecosystem in which you will build your accelerator, what then?

Well, recognizing the community is just the first step. Next, you have to assess the community. What are its assets? What are its shortcomings? 

Before you get visionary, you need to be realistic. So let's start there. With reality. 

This can be fairly ad hoc. You don't need to engage with a bunch of high priced consultants to run focus groups and surveys on your community. Or anthropologists, sociologists, and economists who embed themselves within your community. If you want to do formal, do formal. But it doesn't have to be.  

What you're hoping to answer is two very simple questions: 
1. What resources does your community have? Or, to put it another way, where are the opportunities? 
2. What resources are we missing? In other words, where are the gaps?

## Existing resources

A resource is great. But they fall on a spectrum. And understanding how mature that resource is can be critical. 

You may have a few angel investors in town. But that doesn't mean you have an investment community. You may have a few startups in your community. That doesn't mean you have deal flow. 

Even more importantly, are these resources even accessible?

The apparel industry in Portland, for example — with Nike, Adidas, Columbia, and Under Armour, among others, all boasting significant reach in town — is a hugely valuable asset. But for the most part, that asset of knowledge and an extremely seasoned mentor pool is largely inaccessible to many of the communities in Portland. 

Since it's an asset that can only be accessed by a small subset of the broader community — and since that isn't our community — it's not really an asset. 

So if we got some cockamamie scheme to try to build an apparel accelerator we'd be out of luck. That's not our community. Those aren't our people. And we're not their's. And as such, we'd have no ability to activate that asset.

What's that mean? That's right. That's not really an asset, is it?  To put it another way, an asset is only an asset if your community and accelerator can immediately leverage those resources.

People most often seem to stumble here in terms of capital. If we had a dollar for every accelerator that tried to start a helping a highly capital intensive market with little to no capital assets at their disposal, PIE would be a late stage venture fund. 

If you don't have capital, don't engage in pursuits that capital intensive. If you don't have the asset, don't plan on that asset somehow becoming magically available. Anymore than you should expect community to magically form around an accelerator.

Use, as the phrase goes, what you've got.

## Multipurpose every asset you can

What's more, it's highly likely that you're not going to just want to use that asset in a single way. You want to get as much combined value out of each asset as you can. And to ensure that the asset is deriving value from he relationship. 

So ideally, you'll be seeking to leverage those assets in four ways:
- To the benefit of the early stage founders
- To the benefit of the asset
- To the benefit of the accelerator 
- To the benefit of the community as a whole

## Existing gaps
Where are the gaps?
Are they solvable?
How entrenched are they?
Create one of those annoying Venn diagrams, because those things are a thing for a reason. They actually can help you visualize where the opportunity exists.
Then you can get visionary

# Having a problem assessing the community assets and needs?

Starting a coworking space is a great way to start to unearth some of the assets and gaps in the community.
