# Community
Capturing some of the initial thinking and brainstorming around the topic of "community."

## Discussion

- The accelerator should be a reflection of the community
- It's a means of catalyzing existing community
- Be honest about your community
- You can only work with what you've got
- You have to start with the ingredients your community has, but you don't need to follow the existing community momentum
- You're allowed to bring different ingredients into the community, but the initial activity must start with existing assets
- Some of your community assets may have never combined before (e.g., Portland startup community and W+K), but they're still both assets to be considered
- Once that community is identified, how do you engage with it?
