# Community

When we talk about community, we are talking about physical community. A group of people coming together in a shared space or consistent, shared experience some kind, in a consistent physical location, where actual people interact with other actual people.

## Random collisions?

**An accelerator needs a community, but it will not create one**.

Lots of accelerators get started with the quixotic notion that an accelerator will attract vibrant, excited entrepreneurs wherever the shingle gets hung out.

But the simple reality is that an accelerator project will not create a community. 

Instead, you are carving out a subset of an existing community to create a more tightly knit one. But that initial community must exist for there to be any subset of it.

Startups won’t magically know about a new one and be interested - especially if there’s no existing track record of previous success; time-strapped VC’s will not be drawn magically, mentors will not always see it as their civic duty to give free time to a bunch of long shots, government and local entities are typically focused on job creation which is often a lagging indicator. It's highly likely that your first ‘demo day’, should you choose to have one, will not be oversubscribed. Because communities don't work that way. 

Communities are particular. Communities are fueled by shared purpose.Think about the ones that matter to you - school, work, religion, family. Shared purpose makes small talk easy. So before you start your accelerator, think long and hard about the community you hope to catalyze.

Because while an accelerator won’t create a community, it can be a powerful catalyst for existing ones, or supercharge a nascent one. 


## Accelerator as Community Catalyst


Be honest about the community you have

“Trying to create the next Silicon Valley”


...but dont be trapped by the community you have
Had we taken the pulse of the community alone, we’d have started an Open Source accelerator


Consider mixing and matching community components to catalyze new territories

PIE grew out of a community. A few of them, actually. A disgruntled OpenSource gang, some frustrated co-founders, an agency community looking to engage meaningfully with startups. 

Why would a brand give a shit? Outcomes? Issues? Opportunities?
Hack days

“Free R&D”

Everyone hates the innovator
