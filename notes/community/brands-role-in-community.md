# Brands are part of the community, independent of the community, and a community in their own right — all at the same time

One of the most challenging aspects of working with brands — our lingo for for-profit corporations — is that they can play multiple roles in a community, no role whatsoever, or perform as an insular community all by themselves. This makes them both an intriguing and attractive partner for accelerators — but can make them an equally frustrating partner, as well. 

Proceed with caution. But definitely proceed if the opportunity avails itself.

## Part of the community

## Independent of the community

## Brand as community

Like any community, brands have to honestly assess what assets they bring to the table, as far as accelerators go. In our experience, this process can be as difficult — if not mores — than a typical community assessing its strengths and weaknesses. 

Generally, this assessment results in two outcomes — neither of which is terribly honest.

One outcome is that the brand thinks it has every asset at its disposal. And therefore, can engage in any type of accelerator it chooses. This hubris, while understandable, is often incorrect. No matter how global the brand, it is highly likely that the brand is expert in certain areas. And it is this expertise that the brand show focus on as the key asset. 

Even more challenging? This key asset is often the thing the brand finds to be the most boring part of its business. 

We'll get into that later. 

The second outcome is the polar opposite of the first. And it occurs with all sizes of companies, even global brands. That outcome is the assumption that the company isn't "innovative" or that it has no assets that would be of use to a startup or early stage founder. 

These are brands that either 1) choose not to play at all or 2) determine the only way to engage with the startup community is to outsource the effort to a third party that "gets it."

Like the first outcome, this flawed assumption is a result of the brand not being honest about what assets it possesses and how those assets might be applied to help startups.
