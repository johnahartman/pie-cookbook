# This is just the beginning of the conversation (Backers only)

Thanks again to all of you who have helped support this project with your time, effort, and hard-earned money. We really really appreciate it.

As you can probably tell from our overly communicative Kickstarter campaign, keeping the lines of communication open is really important to us. With that in mind, we wanted to highlight a few of the ways we'd like to stay in touch with you as this campaign moseys off into the sunset in about 24 hours.

- PIE Cookbook Slack: We've established a Slack instance specifically for backers. If you're not familiar with Slack, that's cool. No worries. This will be a good intro. It's a really easy to use chat room. Not only will it help you stay in contact with us, it will help you stay connected to your peers. (Eugene and Corvallis, Oregon, have already been going back and forth and scheming using Slack.) If you're interested in joining us, please send us your preferred email address and we'll get you added. (We cannot see your email address on Kickstarter.) 
- PIE Cookbook on Github: This is an open source project, after all, so we'll be building it out in the open. Never used Github? It's basically a place for us to share all of our files and stuff with you. Not feeling comfortable with that level of geekiness? No worries. We're going to keep everything text based. If you set up a Github account, you can follow our progress. Or you can just stay tuned to the #github room on the Slack instance.
- Monthly standups: We'll plan on having monthly (virtual) standups in the Ask Me Anything (#ama) room on Slack. Everyone is welcome to attend, ask questions, air grievances, complain about my grammar… whatever. Our first standup will be Monday, April 4, 2016 at 10:00AM Pacific Time (-07:00GMT). Can't make it? Feel free to propose questions at your convenience in the #ama room. And we'll make sure everything is archived for your reference, following the standup session.
- Kickstarter updates: Just because the campaign is over doesn't mean we're through using Kickstarter. Even if you don't participate in any of the options above — which is totally fine — we'll still provide regular updates for you here.  
- The usual spots: For a lot of you, Kickstarter is new. So you might not be comfortable with this being your communication platform. If you're more likely to interact with us on social channels, please feel free to follow PIE on Twitter or like PIE on Facebook. Prefer email? We've got you covered. Visit the PIE site and scroll down to the bottom of the page. Or you can sign up here. 

Thanks again! We're looking forward to working with you. And getting your feedback. Not much longer now and we'll be building out the PIE Cookbook! But there's still plenty of time to send folks our way or encourage your peers to join in the fun.

More soon!

Thanks in advance, 
Rick
