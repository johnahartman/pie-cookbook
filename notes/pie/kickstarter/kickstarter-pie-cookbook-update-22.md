# Thank you so much for making this crazy experiment a reality

Wow. Thank you. Thank you for believing in this effort. Thank you for supporting this crazy idea. Thank you for encouraging us to give away everything we've learned over the past eight years with the hopes that it will help someone else do something amazing and awesome for someone else amazing and awesome. 

Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. 

I can't help but think that this is a moment to take a deep breath and reflect. I'm humbled by the community that has come together around this project. And I'm proud to be among you. This is a big deal. And I'm going to take a few minutes to take that in. 

Maybe even a weekend :)

Because like so many things in the startup world, this thing that appears to be an achievement, an accomplishment, a finish line, is — in reality — another starting line. And I can't wait to start the next leg of this race.

I'm really really happy to have the opportunity to work on this with you. Thank you again.

Love, 
Rick

P.S. SQUEEE! Be on the lookout for those backer surveys!
