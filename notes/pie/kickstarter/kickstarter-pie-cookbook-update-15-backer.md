# Achievement unlocked! Let’s get cooking (Backers only)

Wow. You are AWESOME!

Roughly 48 hours ago, we added a new stretch goal. The objective? Get more people joining the community. How? By offering to start this project early if we hit 314 backers.

And guess what? You did it. We have more than 314 backers! That means that the PIE Cookbook is now live.

And while there isn't much to see at this point, as a backer, you now have access to the PIE Cookbook Github repository (https://github.com/piepdx/pie-cookbook) and the PIE Cookbook Slack instance.

*NOTE: We do not have access to your email address. Please feel free to message me on Kickstarter (or you can just reply to your initial thank you email) with the email address that you’d prefer to use. We will manually add you to the PIE Cookbook Slack.*

While we're super excited to be kicking off the project — two weeks early — let’s not forget that we're still two weeks away from the campaign ending. And that means that there is still work to do.

First, we’re convinced that there are other communities out there who could derive value from the PIE Cookbook — but most of them have never even heard of the project. If you can help spread the word, we’ll all be better for it. So thank you, in advance, for doing that.

Second, over the next two weeks, you still have the opportunity to rally your community around our first stretch goal. We’re committed to traveling to meet any community that gets 100 backers for this project (even if those backers are at $1 a piece). So if you’d like to see PIE in person, get your community involved. And we’ll be there.

If you want an example for inspiration, you should see what the communities of Eugene and Corvallis, Oregon are doing.

Thanks again for all of your support, kindness, and willingness to engage in this experiment with us.

Let's get cooking!
