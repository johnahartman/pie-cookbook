# Your votes are in. And the topic we'll be starting with is…

Thanks so much, again, to all of our amazing backers for supporting this project. And for taking the time to participate in our little voting experiment. 

We've managed to tally all of the votes from the campaign and wanted to take a few moments to share the results.

## PIE Cookbook topics: Where to begin? 

One of the areas we asked you to help us consider was where the heck we should start this whole PIE Cookbook thing. What's most confusing? Where do you need help? What's perplexing? 

Admittedly, there's a ton to think about when you're considering building an accelerator. And we have a wealth of topics we're looking forward to covering throughout the course of this process. But we really wanted some guidance on where to start. And we were hopeful that giving you the chance to vote would help us focus on the things that were most important to you. 

You didn't disappoint. 

While a few of the topics were neck and neck, here's how we finally netted out. And the order in which we'll be attacking topics is…

1. Community (Identification, development, management)
2. PIE (History, experiments, mistakes, lessons learned, happy accidents)
2. Funding (Covering the costs of operating an accelerator)
3. Startups (Recruiting, selecting, on boarding, managing)
3. Logistics (Day-to-day activities, running a coworking space/accelerator)
4. Mentors (Recruiting, selecting, on boarding, managing)
6. Partnerships (Recruiting, managing)
7. Space (Square footage, infrastructure, furniture)

## PIE Cookbook Slack: Keeping the conversation going

We have been running a private instance of the PIE Cookbook Slack for a while now, but we were curious as to whether it would be even more useful as a public Slack channel.

Well, backers have spoken.

Nearly 95% of the votes cast recommended that we open up the PIE Cookbook Slack to the broader community. So that's exactly what we'll be doing. 

If you're a Kickstarter backer and haven't yet responded to your Slack invite, please do that at your earliest convenience. We'd like to make sure that you have access to a special private channel for our backers before we open up the platform to the public. 

## PIE Cookbook roadshow
We're just going to chalk this one up as a failed experiment. 

We asked folks to cast votes for which town we should visit as part of the PIE Cookbook roadshow, continuing on a theme we started during the course of the Kickstarter campaign: [any town that got more than 66 votes would be a candidate for a visit from the PIE team](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/turoczy/pie-cookbook-an-open-source-guide-for-startup-acce/posts/1529377). 

In the long run, this voting reflected (or fell short) of [Kickstarter's community metrics on the campaign](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/turoczy/pie-cookbook-an-open-source-guide-for-startup-acce/community). So we're just going with that. 

See you soon, Eugene, Oregon!

## Next steps
In case you missed it, [we've outlined a proposed process for moving forward with this project](https://medium.com/portland-incubator-experiment/kickstarter-pie-cookbook-update-31-2acf760d014c#.2z41ccpw3 "Proposing a process for building the PIE Cookbook in public"). And we're already underway composing content around the topic of "community."

As always, you can participate by following along on [Github](https://github.com/piepdx/pie-cookbook/) or by joining us on Slack.

Just as important, we're hard at work producing your awesome backer rewards. So that you can be appropriately ensconced in PIE gear throughout this whole thing.

Thanks again for your help. More soon. Stay tuned!

Take care,
Rick
