# Okay. Let's do this. 
## Proposing a process for building the PIE Cookbook in public

Howdy,

Hope you're doing well! 

If you're just joining us — or you've lost the thread — let's bring you up-to-date on all of the PIE Cookbook fun. Whether you backed this project originally or not. 

We've officially closed the backer voting, both for the starting topic for the [PIE Cookbook](https://github.com/piepdx/pie-cookbook "PIE Cookbook") and for all of the towns in the running for an in-person visit from PIE. 

Thanks to all of you who voted!

Now, it's time to get to work. I mean, on the book. (We've been hard at work producing your rewards this whole time.) So while we're waiting for PWC to validate the voting results, we thought it might be a good idea to establish some semblance of a process for managing this whole writing thing. 

(Please note: Given the fact that we've never written an entire book in public before, this process is a first attempt. An experiment. And like many things with PIE, this process is subject to change. Or fail completely.)

## First things first

Before we get into all of this process stuff, please bear in mind that this is an open source project and that none of the process below precludes contributors from:
 
- Chatting with us on the [PIE Cookbook Slack](http://piecookbook.slack.com/ "PIE Cookbook Slack")
- Posting questions to the [Ask Me Anything channel on PIE Cookbook Slack](https://piecookbook.slack.com/messages/ama/ "PIE Cookbook Slack #ama")
- Making [Pull Requests](https://github.com/piepdx/pie-cookbook/pulls "PIE Cookbook pull requests")
- Submitting [Issues](https://github.com/piepdx/pie-cookbook/issues "PIE Cookbook Issues") 

That's for any topic, at any time. Process be damned! 
 

## PIE Cookbook development process

Now that we've set some ground rules, here's what we're thinking for the development process.

0. **Standups**. We will be increasing the regularity of the PIE Cookbook standups. Instead of monthly, we'll begin meeting on a weekly basis. As of June 6, 2016, PIE Cookbook standups will be held every Monday, 10:00AM - 10:15AM Pacific Time (currently -07:00 GMT) in the [Ask Me Anything channel on PIE Cookbook Slack](https://piecookbook.slack.com/messages/ama/ "PIE Cookbook Slack #ama").

1. **Brainstorming sprint**. For any given topic, the PIE team will start with a sprint to brainstorm content areas, assess potential supporting topics, deep dive into specific subjects within the topic, determine impact on the PIE Cookbook as a whole, and — perhaps most importantly — assign tasks for who is writing what. We'll keep folks apprised of our progress on Slack or you can keep an eye on the [Github repository](https://github.com/piepdx/pie-cookbook/ "PIE Cookbook on Github").
2. **Content development**. The brainstorming session will be followed by at least one week of team members diverging into individual thoughts and contributions on the area of focus. This step will go on as long as it has to, within reason, until we feel we've exhausted the topic. You'll be able to see all of the progress — as it happens — in the [Notes](https://github.com/piepdx/pie-cookbook/tree/master/notes) section. This activity may also result in the creation — or recycling — of [PIE blog posts](https://medium.com/portland-incubator-experiment "PIE (Portland Incubator Experiment) on Medium").
2. **Anchoring content**. Once we've generated an appreciable — but probably not exhaustive — amount of content on the subject, we'll look at the [Outline](https://github.com/piepdx/pie-cookbook/blob/master/notes/outline.md) and start anchoring chunks of content to the appropriate sections of the PIE Cookbook. (To put it another way, we'll be writing random smatterings from throughout the Cookbook; not writing this cover to cover.) This effort will be designed to highlight additional areas for development around that particular topic. In addition, this step will provide more contextual reference for members of the PIE Cookbook community. That way no-one is forced to play the "Guess what's in our heads" game. 
3. **Public Comment**. Even though folks are welcome chat with us on the [PIE Cookbook Slack](http://piecookbook.slack.com/ "PIE Cookbook Slack"), make [Pull Requests](https://github.com/piepdx/pie-cookbook/pulls "PIE Cookbook pull requests"), or submit [Issues](https://github.com/piepdx/pie-cookbook/issues "PIE Cookbook Issues") on the project at any time, we feel it might be helpful to have a designated "Public Comment" period for each topic. This will give both the PIE team and the PIE Cookbook community a definitive milestone toward which to work. We will announce the beginning and end of the public comment period based on the amount of content under review and reasonable review times for that content. During this time, PIE staff will make no additional edits to the existing content while we await feedback from the community.  
4. **Revisions sprint**. At the close of the Public Comment period, the PIE team will work to implement the revisions or additions proposed during the Public Comment period. Once complete, this topic content will be published to the [Drafts](https://github.com/piepdx/pie-cookbook/tree/master/drafts "PIE Cookbook Drafts") section within the broader context of the PIE Cookbook. (Note: In the early going, this will cause the content to be disjointed and spotty. Over time, that issue will resolve itself.)
5. **Lather. Rinse. Repeat**.

## Proposed milestones

That process is all well and good. But what are we really working towards here? That's right. A book. So it would make sense that we establish some milestones and deadlines for that book, wouldn't it? Right again. It would.

1. **Skeleton**. Ideally, PIE will work toward building a working minimum valuable cookbook before spending time fleshing out the finer points of the documentation. In other words, we want to get to a workable prototype first. That way, the PIE Cookbook community will have a skeleton version of the document — more robust than the outline, less filling than the completed tome — with which to work, muck around with, and critique even before the final version is complete. **This milestone will be PIE Cookbook 0.9**. We are currently targeting completion of this milestone for the end of Q3 2016 (read late September, early October-ish). It will be published in [Docs in the PIE Cookbook Github repository](https://github.com/piepdx/pie-cookbook/tree/master/docs "PIE Cookbook Docs").
2. **Fleshing out**. As PIE Cookbook 0.9 is refined, we will flesh out the sections in context, create transitions, and stitch the content together with the hopes that it will be more digestible as an actual book. **This milestone will be PIE Cookbook 1.0**. The projected completion date for this milestone will be end of year 2016. (Note: Like all development projects and due dates, it is highly likely that this date will slip. We're not naive. But we'd prefer to put a stake in the sand.) 

So that's where we are. Sound good? Cool. 

We'll be revealing the initial topic, next week. Questions to me.

Have a good weekend! And we'll see you [on the Slacks](http://piecookbook.slack.com/ "PIE Cookbook Slack") and [on the Github](https://github.com/piepdx/pie-cookbook "PIE Cookbook on Github").

<3 Rick
