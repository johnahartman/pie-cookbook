# Quick update on our first week of post-funding progress
Howdy,

Hope you had a good week, free from my constant updates. Just so we don't drop into complete radio silence, I wanted to provide a quick update for everyone.

* We're in the midst of building the backer surveys. Be on the lookout for those next week. We need your help choosing where to start this whole thing. Plus, you'll have the opportunity to tell us which town gets credit for your participation â€” and might qualify for an in-person visit from PIE.
* If you're not already on the PIE Cookbook Slack, you should have an invite waiting for you in the email associated with your Kickstarter account. (It may have wound up in spam.) Please join up as soon as you can as more than 200 of us are already delving into PIE Cookbook stuff over there.
* We're finalizing designs on the socks (for all of you who were smart enough to pick that reward).
* And remember, the PIE Cookbook is being built out in the open on Github. You can monitor progress there and review the living outline here: https://github.com/piepdx/pie-cookbook/blob/master/notes/outline.md

Have a good weekend!

Hope that helps, 
Rick
