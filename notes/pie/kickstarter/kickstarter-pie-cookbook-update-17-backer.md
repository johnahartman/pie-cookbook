# Join us on Slack! (Backers only)

Just a reminder that if you're a backer, you have unlocked early access to the PIE Cookbook Slack instance. And if you're from Corvallis, Eugene, or Portland, you've already unlocked the Slack stretch goal that gives you your own channel on our Slack.

To be added to Slack, just send me a note with your preferred email address and I'll send you an invite.

Know someone else who should be joining this conversation? There are only a few more days before the campaign ends. So please, tell your friends. Because we'd love to come visit you in person. All it takes is a buck.
